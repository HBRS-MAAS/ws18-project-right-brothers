    \item \textbf{Explantion about its working}:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item The \textbf{Clock} behaviour has two steps. Based on current status, one of the step will be executed.
            \item The first step is to send messages (\texttt{TimeStep}) to each and every alive agent. This will be INFORM type. This tells all the agent to perform the task they are supposed to do in that particular time step.
            \item Once they are done with any actions that they are supposed to perform in a particular time step, they will respond (\texttt{Finished}) with an INFORM message. Then they will wait for another \texttt{TimeStep} message before performing any actions.
            \item The second step is to wait for responce from all alive agents. Once it gets all the responce messages, it increaments the \texttt{currentTime} (which signifies the simulation time). 
            \item The \texttt{done} method checks if the \texttt{currentTime} is more than \texttt{endTime} (read from \texttt{meta.json}). If it is then it will call \texttt{Shutdown} behaviour otherwise it will execute first step.

\section{Order Aggregation}%
\begin{itemize}
    \item As mentioned in the slides, the expected order times are as follows,
    \begin{enumerate}
    	\item 50\% to 100\% of the orders from super markets and sales shops arrive at the end of the day before delivery. They are next day orders. The remaining orders $<$ 50\% orders from the super markets and sales shops arrive on the same day as delivery.
    	\item All the orders from hospitals and old age homes arrive once a day (might not be fixed time), but for next day delivery.
    	\item Some customers like catering services, clubs etc make orders several days ahead of delivery.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item To ensure freshness and the reputation of the bakery, products can only be produced on the day of the order (however the dough preparation should also be done on the same day or not is not mentioned so we assume there is no restriction on that.)
    \item With this overview in mind we can see that before the start of the shift, the information about the next day orders is already known and hence the dough preparation can be planned for all the orders combined as it is independent of the type of product to be made.
    \item From the orders which are received (at the end of the delivery) for the super markets for the next day delivery, we can approximate them to be around 75\% ((50+100)/2) of the total orders expected and we can assume that we might get another 25\% (100-75) of orders on the same day as delivery. This is just an \textbf{estimated guess}. 
    \item In reality, it might happen that,
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item the same day orders might be less than 25\% of the total next day orders. 
    \item sometimes they might be more than 25\% of the total next day orders. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item For the prior case, the dough is already available. For the latter case the amount of orders which are  $>$ 25\% cannot be accepted.
    \item Based on the above intuition, the order processing agent creates a work plan at the start of each shift. 
\end{itemize}
